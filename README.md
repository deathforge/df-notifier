df-notifier
===========

Send alerts to your phone when your battleground or dungeon is ready.

Installation
===========
Requires installation of:
http://www.sikuli.org/ - Sikuli
http://www.python.com/ - Python 2.7.8
http://www.java.com - Java 8

Most of these you will likely have already installed. If not, I'd recommend using Ninite (http://www.ninite.com).
Sikuli has a .jar that can install on any platform.

Once all of the dependencies have been installed, move the df-notifier.sikuli folder anywhere on your system, and run it with PATH-TO-SIKULI/sikuli-ide.exe -r df-notifier.sikuli

note: you will also need to update the image as the resolution may throw it off
